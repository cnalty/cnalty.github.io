# About Me

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland. I am expecting to graduate in May of 2021 with two degrees, Bachelor's in Computer Science and Bachelor's in Mathematics. Following this I hope to continue my education by pursing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing.

I have an extreme interest in Deep Neural Networks and Data Science. The framework I am most familiar with is PyTorch, but have also done basic work with OpenVINO. Below are repositories using fully connected and convolutional neural networks.

# Gait Estimation
This project involved estimating how people walk, known as gait. A pose estimation network was used to extract keypoints on peoples bodies. Using these each persons arm and leg movements were stabalized based on their torso position. The stabalized arm and leg movements were then fitted to a sin wave using Basin-hopping. This method also produces a torso stabilized video of each person walking.

# Character Recognition
This repository contains a simple convolutional neural network for recognition of handwritten digits. Trained and tested using Kaggle distributions of the MNIST dataset and the Kannada MNIST dataset. Accuracy results can be found in the repositroy.

# Genetic Algorithms for Training Neural Nets
This repository has methods for for using genetic algorithms to train neural networks. There are a few basic mobile and arcade style games used to showcase and test. The methods have only been tested for training on fully connected layers, but have been run on convolutional layers. May work with other layers as well.
