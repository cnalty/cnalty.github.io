Robotic Perception
=====
I'm a first year PhD student working on vision based robotic control at Oregon State University. I am part of the
[Dynamic Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://mime.engineering.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/index.html)
where I use deep learning based methods to give bipedal robots, such as [Digit](https://agilityrobotics.com/robots), 
the capability to perceive and interact with the world. My research goals involve extending visual 
loco-manipulation tasks to be language conditioned through the use of multi-modal foundation models.

I am advised by [Alan Fern](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/alan-fern) and frequently collaborate with 
[Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/). I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Maryland
where I worked with [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/) on face verification and completed my honors 
thesis on reinforcement learning with [James Reggia](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~reggia/).

LLMs and Game AI
=====
Outside my formal research, I am extremely interested in Large Language Models as well as using games as benchmarks for 
AI. Previously I've coded [PPO](https://openai.com/research/openai-baselines-ppo) and [DDQN](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10295)
from scratch to play multiple games on the [Arcade Learning Environment](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10819). 
Currently, I'm working to fine-tune LLMs to play [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) to compare with an 
In-Context Learning method presented in [PokeLLMon](https://poke-llm-on.github.io/). This work will be made public 
shortly after OSUs 2024 winter term.
